"""

The CSV files to be ran must be found in the same
directory as the sorting algorithms. 

To run the algorithm, run <sorting_algorithm> <csv_file>

For example, to sort an input file named 'test_input.csv' using HeapSort.py, type:
'HeapSort.py test_input'

After the sorted array has been printed, there are two addition lines printed:
1) Status of output array. If Sorted, returns True, if failed, returns False
2) Time that algorithm took to run in seconds

*** Please note that CountingSort.py takes much longer than heapsort and quicksort ***
